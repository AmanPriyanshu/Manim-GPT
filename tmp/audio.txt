In this visualization, we explore the fundamental architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Starting from an input layer, observe how convolutional filters process the input to generate feature maps, followed by pooling to reduce dimensions. We then connect these through fully connected layers, resulting in classification output. Let's now see how the entire CNN seamlessly transforms input data to output predictions.
