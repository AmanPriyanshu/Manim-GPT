The visualization begins with a basic 2D grid symbolizing an image input to the CNN, labeled as the input layer. Then, we move to the first convolutional layer, showcasing filters sliding over the image grid to generate feature maps, illustrating the convolution process. Next, transition to the ReLU activation layer highlights the activated feature map values. The pooling layer follows, demonstrating size reduction via max pooling. Finally, the sequence stacks layers, concluding at the output layer, symbolizing final classification.
