In this three-part visualization, we start by introducing a 2D grid representing an input image, highlighting sections that are being processed. We then show how convolutional filters slide over the image and capture features, illustrating the overlaps distinctly. Lastly, different filters are applied simultaneously to produce a complex feature map, showcasing their combined effects.
